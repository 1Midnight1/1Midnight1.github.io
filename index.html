        There's no better way to truly understand something than to build it
        from scratch. In this project, I built a PyTorch-like API to build
        neural networks in Rust, currently supporting simple convolutional
        neural networks. I used wgpu (a low level graphics API that minimally
        abstracts over vulkan, directX and metal) and compute shaders to achieve
        GPU acceleration. I then trained it on the FashionMNIST dataset,
        achieving impressive accuracy.

        The project focuses on automating quality control in guava farming by
        detecting diseases like Anthracnose and fruit fly infestations with
        computer vision. I compared three machine learning
        techniques—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines
        (SVMs), and Random Forests—to determine the best approach for accuracy,
        efficiency, and reliability. By identifying an optimal method, we aim to
        reduce inspection times, improve food safety, and promote sustainable
        farming practices.

        The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions
        (COMPAS) was a system used to assess risks of recidivisim (likelihood to
        reoffend) in the criminal population. Unfortunately, the creators of the
        system, as well as the judicial bodies using it failed to properly
        evaluate it before it was put into use and it was found that COMPAS was
        causing more harm than doing good. This project aims to reproduce some
        of their failures with a logistic regression model to predict the
        recidivism scores assigned to people by COMPAS, and show how proper
        evaluation and tuning of the model and data can lead to a more fair

        The goal of the project is to create an AR platform that facilitates
        social, educational, and entertaining experiences through one cohesive
        user experience. Social experiences are facilitated by allowing users to
        place AR objects in the real world for others to see. Users will be able
        to have friends on the platform, and engage in the unique social
        interactions made possible by the platform both privately with friends,
        and publicly. Educational experiences will be provided by businesses on
        our platform through AR tours. Users can participate in these tours and
        provide both text and visual enhancement to any setting, whether it be a
        national park or a historic site. Entertaining experiences will be
        provided by on demand AR projection in any space that will allow users
        to see what interesting things from around the world might look like up
        close.
